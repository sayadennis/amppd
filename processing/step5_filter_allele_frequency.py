#     exac <- table$ExAC_ALL # ExAC frequencies - but in factors.
#     levels(exac)[levels(exac)=="."] <- "0" # changing missing values to zero for the purpose of creating logical vector in line 12
#     new_exac <- as.numeric(levels(exac))[exac] # changing factors to numeric and saving to new vector
#     below_thres <- new_exac<0.9 # logical vector of TRUE or FALSE (no NA since all of "." is changed to 0 in line 10)
